At the moment it's a calculator for multiple attack rolls in dnd 






Hitrate:

If you haven't played dnd before this might be a bit confusing, so I'll give some examples here:

1) You are rolling to try and hit a target with defense (AC) 15 and you have a bonus to hit of +5: 
you roll a 20 sided dice and add 5

    rolling a 1 always misses
    rolling a 5 + 5 = 10. 10 < 15  ----> miss
    rolling a 10 + 5 = 15. if you get exactly the target, you hit
    
    so rolling a 10 or higher hits. That's 11 faces of the 20 sided dice, or a 55% chance of hitting

2) Target has AC 200, your modifier is +5
    whatever you roll on the dice, your result will be less than 200.
    But, rolling a 20 = automatic hit, regardless of modifier or AC.
    So 20 = hit, anything else = miss, you have 5% chance to hit 

3) target has AC 0 your modifier is +20
    Any dice roll plus your modifier will be bigger than 0, 
    But rolling a 1 = automatic miss
    so at best you can have 95% chance to hit
