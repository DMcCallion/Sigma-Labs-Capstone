My Sigma Labs prework capstone project


This is a tool for a dungeon master running dnd 5th edition.
If your players are fighting a single dragon, running the combat is very easy manually, but if you want to have them fight 30 zombies, suddenly things slow down big time.

This tool's aim is to help running large groups of creatures in dnd combat.
It chooses targets for attacks, and rolls all the dice for you, so you can focus on description (or worrying about what the necromancer who summoned all these zombies is doing)

For people who aren't familiar with dnd combat: https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Combat


stretch goals: deal with positions and initiative (although at this point I'm basically making a whole vtt)


Hitrate:

If you haven't played dnd before this might be a bit confusing, so I'll give some examples here:

1: You are rolling to try and hit a target with defense (AC) 15 and you have a bonus to hit of +5: 
you roll a 20 sided dice and add 5

    rolling a 1 always misses
    rolling a 5 + 5 = 10. 10 < 15  ----> miss
    rolling a 10 + 5 = 15. if you get exactly the target, you hit
    
    so rolling a 10 or higher hits. That's 11 faces of the 20 sided dice, or a 55% chance of hitting

2: Target has AC 200, your modifier is +5
    whatever you roll on the dice, your result will be less than 200.
    But, rolling a 20 = automatic hit, regardless of modifier or AC.
    So 20 = hit, anything else = miss, you have 5% chance to hit 

3: target has AC 0 your modifier is +20
    Any dice roll plus your modifier will be bigger than 0, 
    But rolling a 1 = automatic miss
    so at best you can have 95% chance to hit
